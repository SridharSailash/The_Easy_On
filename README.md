The_Easy_One

it was not soo easy and only 10pts. i knew it that it would be a QR code . i used a website to alter the image's rgb colours level and even did LSB HALF but i didnt notice the subtle qr code . On the last day i asked alan chettan many times and he told that it is very easy and im close so i did it again and noticed the light qr code. then i searched and found a website to convert image to LSB FULL. then i got a qr . i scanned it and then got the flag.
